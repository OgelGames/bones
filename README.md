## Improvements from MTG

- **Dynamically sized inventory** - To fit ALL your items.
- **Inventory restoration** - Items return to the original places when collecting bones.
- **Better bone generation** - Always finds somewhere to place bones, 98% guaranteed.
- **No lost items** - Bones have multiple fallback modes and if they all fail you keep your items.
- **Bone pickup** - Bones can be picked up with items inside using sneak+punch.
- **Waypoints** - Bones are marked by a waypoint for a configurable amount of time.
- **Game independent** - Doesn't depend on the `default` mod.
- **New textures** - More detailed and... better.
- **Custom sounds** - Because bones are not made of gravel.
